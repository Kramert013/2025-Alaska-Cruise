           <h3> <li>The Adventure Bag</li></h3>
            <p> This is where you will keep all your important travel documents and items critical to get where you're going. The adventure bag is a small backpack for me, but it can be any type of bag or purse. It should be something small and light that you can carry all day that will stay on your person the entire time of traveling.
                This includes not checking it while flying or checking it at the gate. Below I have listed what I carry in my adventure pack.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Passport and ID</li>
                    <li>Boarding passes, flight tickets, bus tickets or any other critical travel documents</li>
                    <li>Ear plugs and headphones. (in case of noisy passangers)</li>
                    <li>Pen and small pad of paper</li>
                    <li>Reusable, sealable water bottle. Take them into airports empty and fill them up once you're at the gate. 
                        Also great for filling up on the cruise ship rather than having to wait at the bar for water.</li>
                    <li>Spare socks and underwear. Because a sneeze gone wrong can make shit happen.</li>
                    <li>Phone charger</li>
                    <Li>Sunglasses. If you wear regular glasses this is where I recommend keeping your glasses case, cleaner, etc. Same concept with contacts. </Li>
                    <li>Snacks. I typically carry protien bars and nuts to ensure I have some protien dense food with lots of nurtients.</li>
                    <li>Medication and basic first aid 
                        <ul>
                            <li>2 days of prescription medications in case luggage gets delayed or lost.</li>
                            <li>Advil or Ibuprofen for possible pain or aches from travel or general discomfort.</li>
                            <li>Dramamine to help prevent motion sickenss for you or someone in your party.</li>
                            <li>Tumbs</li>
                            <li>Bandaids and small gause</li>
                            <li>Wet wipes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>Cash. There is always a place for cash with traveling. Tips, parking fees, tolls, etc. I reccomend carrying $50-100 as seen below for best general use:
                        <ul>
                            <li>$1 dollar bills x 10</li>
                            <li>$5 dollar bills x 2</li>
                            <li>$10 dollar bill x 1</li>
                            <li>$20 dollar bill x 1</li>
                            <li>$50 dollar bill x 1 (optional)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>            
                </ul>
                <p></p>
        
            <h3><li>The Carry On</li></h3>
            <p> Like the adventure bag, the carry on will stay with you during travel. I typically use a smaller roller suitcase for this.  This bag should act as an extenstion of the adventure bag for some larger more bulky items, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full change of cloths in case checked luggage shows up later than expected or you spill something all over yourself and need a change of clothes. </li>
                    <li>Flip flops</li>
                    <li>Hoodie</li>
                    <li>Travel blanket</li>
                    <li>Travel size toothpaste and brush</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>
            
            <h3><li>Checked Luggage</li></h3>
        
                <p>This is the main bag that gets checked when flying and and will get checked at the port when you board the ship. It will show up in your room on the on ship a few hours later. Size depends on how long of a trip and how much you will want to pack with you. As for what to pack, its 
                    for everything else not in your first two bags and everything else your heart desires to bring.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clothes</li>
                        <li>Shoes</li>
                        <li>Toiletries</li>
                        <li>Towels</li>
                        <li>Blankets</li>
                        <li>Dirty laundry bag (more useful than you would think)</li>                            
                    </ul>                    
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't like taking so many bags? Try to combine the first two into a singular adventure/carry on bag. </li>
            <li>Try not to fill the bags more than 75% full so you have room for souvenirs. </li>
        </ul>
