            <h3><li>Use a 3 tier packing system</li></h3>        
            <p> Nailing the 3 bag loadout can save a lot of 
                stress and uncomfortable situations during travels. For example: You check your luggage at the airport 
                and it gets lost or removed from the flight for various reasons. That would be a bad place to have your 
                ID and/or passports not be with you. To avoid such situations, I have listed how I like do my load outs which are designed by a priority of items of what goes in which in which bag. Aka, nailing the load out. When done well and kept organzied, each bag should be 
                no more than 75% full that way there is room for souvenirs. Click the link to take you to a guide to the 3 tier packing system.</p>

                    <h3><li>Be prepared and arrive early</li></h3>
                    <p>Reduce the stress of travel by preparing early and arriving where you need to be in a timely mannor with excess time in the occasion there is some unexpected delays.
                    And rememeber that there could be a delay at every leg of the travel. If you show up to the airport gate really early. Great! go grab a coffee or mimosa. After all it is a vaction.            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wake up early enough to eat, travel, go through airport security and arrive at least 30 min prior to boarding time at your gate. </li>
                    <li>Have a solid dedicated ride to the airport well in advance by a friend, family member or preoder a Uber to pick you up at a set time. If you are driving youself, look into 
                    business or hotel parking availibily near the airport you are traveling to. It could save you some money and some hotels even provide a shuttle if you pay a low fee to park there and its usually cheaper than airport parking.
                    From there you can shuttle or take a cheap Uber to the airport. </li>
                    <li>Check in to your flight online up to 24hrs prior to the flight to speed up the process when you arrive at the airport. </li>
                    <li>Be no less than 30 min early to your gate. Gate changes can happen at any time and is not uncommon. Give yourself plenty of time to redirect yourself to where you need to be if there are any changes in the plan.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="four">
            <h3><li>Do your research</li></h3>
            <p>Look at your destinations, ports of call and places you will be traveling through. Look for things like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Weather of your destinations and airports on the travel dates</li>
                <li>Local events going on at your destinations. This may give you ideas of things to do. Or it could mean some things you want to do may be closed for the event.</li>
                <li>Talk around to freinds, family or coworkers and see if anyone has been to your destinations and ask what they most enjoyed, things that they could have done better or any notes that are helpful.</li>          
            </ul>
             </div>
             <div class="five">
            <h3><li>Let somone know your plans</li></h3>
            <p>Im not saying advertise to everyone your leaving. I actually recommend not posting on social media that your leaving and will not be home. Alternativly post after you back with great images.
                But deffinatly tell one or two people you trust your travel plans. Share your itinerary with them so if there is an emergency situation, somone can support you from the homefront.

            <h3><li>Other quick Tips</li></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always carry a sealable water bottle with you when you are out an about to stay hydrated.</li>
                    <li>Dont keep all you cash on you. Keep some in your luggage in a container such as an old (washed) Altoids can, Chew pouch can or anything that is not obvious to have money in it. Most hotels and cruises vet their employess pretty good.
                        But some extra percaustions never hurt. Also, keep in mind the mini safes in your room are not as safe as they seem, employess have to access them to reset them when you are finished with your stay. </li>
                    <li>Give youself extra time when traveling with large groups or children</li>
                    <li>Dont over do it. Going too hard one day could cost you valuable time later. Weather you hiked too far and are sore, drank too much or pushed yourself too far in general.</li>
                    <li>Lastly and most important. Smile, its okay to enjoy yourself and be happy. Thats what vacations are for.</li>
